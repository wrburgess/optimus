Compare the agent configuration standards between Optimus and the target MPI project: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Resolve the target project path**:
   - Read `.claude/projects.json` to find the project by name (avails, sfa, garden, harvest)
   - Read `.claude/projects.local.json` for local paths if available
   - If no local path, use `gh api` to fetch files from the GitHub repo

2. **Read Optimus shared standards** (the source of truth):
   - `CLAUDE.md` — shared sections: Permissions and Autonomy, Commit and PR Standards, Agent Attribution, Required Workflow, Commands, Testing, Key Gems
   - `AGENTS.md` — shared sections: Pre-Commit Requirements, PR Instructions, Review Guidelines, Agent Attribution
   - `.claude/hooks/enforce-branch-creation.sh`
   - `.claude/commands/` — all command templates
   - `docs/standards/testing.md`
   - `docs/standards/code-review.md`
   - `docs/standards/documentation.md`
   - `docs/standards/style.md`
   - `docs/standards/hc-review-checklist.md`
   - `docs/standards/cross-repo-sync.md`
   - `docs/architecture/agent-workflow.md`

3. **Read the target project's corresponding files** (if they exist)

4. **Compare and report**:
   - Which shared files are missing in the target project
   - Which shared files exist but have drifted from the Optimus version
   - Which project-specific sections are correctly customized
   - Specific lines or sections that differ

5. **Generate recommendations**:
   - Files to copy as-is (pure shared standards)
   - Files to merge (shared skeleton + project-specific content)
   - Sections to update in existing files

## Output Format
