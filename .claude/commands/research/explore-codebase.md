Explore the Optimus codebase for the topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Understand the topic** — determine what area of the codebase is relevant
2. **Read architecture docs** — start with `docs/architecture/overview.md` and any relevant docs in `docs/`
3. **Search the codebase** — use Grep and Glob to find relevant files, classes, methods, and patterns
4. **Read key files** — read the most relevant files in full to understand implementation details
5. **Trace relationships** — follow associations, concerns, controller actions, and view templates to understand how the pieces connect
6. **Summarize findings** — provide a clear report of what you found

## Output Format

Provide a structured report with:
- **Relevant files** — list with brief descriptions of what each does
- **Current implementation** — how the system works today
- **Key patterns** — conventions and patterns used in this area
- **Dependencies** — what other systems this touches
- **Potential concerns** — anything to be aware of when making changes
